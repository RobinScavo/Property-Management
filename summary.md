# Property management

- Adding the image gallary slowed the site considerably. So far I've tried manually minifying the images to limited effect. I may need to use a plugin but this points to the need for Gatsby or something.


- Using flex box is still my preferred method for responsiveness but grid can be useful for large collections of similar elements (bunch of boxes etc.)

- Using percent (%) and viewport width (vw) for width and auto for height works well for responsiveness. Space the height using margin and padding (preferably in a reset css file).

- I need to build my own custom css reset file where I also keep commonly used variables.
